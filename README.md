## Overview: 
### In this project I will be creating a ski resort website in which you can look up ski resorts in the east coast. You will be able to see reviews and also see conditions of the ski resort. You will additionally be able to see the weather at these resorts using an api. 

## Requirements: 
- Be a new repo
- Have separate directories for the frontend (client) and backend within the main repository
- Include a beautiful, professional README.md (use markdown)
- Your README should have links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used, a getting started section (with links to your deployed site and Trello), screenshots of your final product (no more than 2-3), future updates, and credits.
- Include a minimum of 3 models (Postgres, Sequelize, or Mongoose)
- Have full CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) on at least one model
- Use functional components with React hooks.
- Have at least 60 meaningful git commits - You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.
- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. DO NOT leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice).
- Be deployed
